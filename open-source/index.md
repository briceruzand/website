## Why Open Source ?


The viky.ai platform is an open source platform designed to create natural language processes called agents.

We have created this platform as Open Source in the hope that it will be used by many people and many companies.

But in order to be clear about what is open source and what is not, we wanted to say this: everything is open source, except the agent that you have created and that you want to keep for yourself (or your company).

We encourage sharing information and sharing your agents, but we also encourage privacy.



## Open Source and Open Data


As we have mentioned before, agents are processes that are used within the viky.ai platform to analyse texts. But agent can also be viewed as data as they are really represented by a json structure, which then executed on by the viky.ai NLP component.

In that regard, an agent can be view as a bunch of NLP rules descriptions, thus an agent is data. However those rules are then compiled and executed by the the viky.ai NLP component, thus an agent can be also viewed as a source code.

We can also view the viky.ai platform as an Open Source platform that, at the beginning, does not contain any agent.

This platform is then populated by agents.

So in our mind, when we speak of the Open Source part of viky.ai we speak about the platform without its content (the agents). And when we speak about Open Data, we speak about the agents.

Agents have associated information, which are not vital for them to run, but which are nice to have:

* The readme part of the agent, which is the description,
* All documentations associated with the agent,
* the tests associated with the agents, which can be view as running examples of what the agent can do.

Please note that agent can also contain javascript code (for building semantic solution), and that this code is part of the agent.


## Public and private agents

Agents are independant from the platform. They can be downloaded from the platform or uploaded into the platform.

Agents can be public: it means that they can be used by anybody, but agents can be also private, which means that only you and those with whom you have shared them can see them and possibly change them.

This privacy part is an important part of the view we have on open source and open data: a source and a data can be deemed open only if it is possible to have private source and data.
