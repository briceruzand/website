## Manage images

In order to support retina display and to ensure consistency in the display, please follow these instructions:

* Take screenshot with a minimum viewport width of 1320px and a pixel density of 2.
* Use a tool like [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com) or [Trimage image compressor](https://trimage.org/) in order to make images load faster.
* Favor PNG format for UI screenshots.
