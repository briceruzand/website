#### What is viky.ai ?  

viky.ai is a NLP (Natural Language Processing) platform able to support you in extracting information from unstructured contents.  
It is composed of a codeless user interface to create Agents that are your assistants to find relevant data.  
Creation of entities and interpretations has never been as simple !  
viky.ai supports multiple languages.

In some minutes, your unstructured contents will reveal the substance of what they hide. This will enrich your structured data and allow you to imagine new Business Cases.

You could use it at 2 phases of your data value chain :  
- upstream of the value chain to structure your contents and extract relevant data (to create metadata or enrich indexes for instance)
- downstream of the value chain to send queries in natural language to find the right information. viky.ai even offers the possibility to create virtual assistants to converse with your data.
Same modules can be used upstream and downstream.
