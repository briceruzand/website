Dear all, I will be at the Voice Tech Paris on November, 26th 2019 to present a keynote on Voice Recognition and <acronym title="Natural Language Processing">NLP</acronym>.

I will talk about the state of the art and latest advanced research on these technologies.

<!--keep reading-->

In details, I will present the main parts that make up the <acronym title="Natural Language Processing">NLP</acronym>/<acronym title="Natural Language Understanding">NLU</acronym>, and I will show the recent innovations on these different parts, why they work or not depending on their uses.

I will also talk about Machine Learning, where it works, where it doesn't, and why.

If you can come, do not hesitate to discuss with me.
