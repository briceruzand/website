**Today is a yet another great day**, the viky.ai platform is now available in open source!

We have been working for more than two years on this new platform, and have made our best efforts to build an easy to use, well documented platform.

But this was not enough! We wanted for anyone to have no stop whatsoever to use the platform. This meant "open source" for us!

<!--keep reading-->

In other words, even though we believe it is the best and easiest way for you to create your agents and play with them on the viky.ai platform, some of you will want to create your own platform for your own use. And this is very good.

Please note that your agents are completely private and safe in the viky.ai SaaS platform: the platform is using a secured connection (https), and your agents are associated with a security token that you can renew anytime. This token is used to secure the API access to your bot.

So please:
* Feel free to create your own viky.ai platform.
* But also feel secure on the viky.ai SaaS platform.

Go to the [github repository](https://github.com/viky-ai) to enjoy a whole lot of NLP code and more!
