Voice Recognition, NLP / NLU: state of the art and latest advanced research on these technologies

I will present the main parts that make up the NLP/NLU, and I will show the recent innovations on these different parts, why they work or not depending on their uses.
The machine learning is discussed and I will show where it works, where it doesn't, and why.
