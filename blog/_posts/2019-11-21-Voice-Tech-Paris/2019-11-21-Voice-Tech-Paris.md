Dear all, I will be at the Voice Tech Paris on November, 26th 2019 to present a key note on Voice Recognition and NLP.

I will talk about the state of the art and latest advanced research on these technologies.

In details, I will present the main parts that make up the NLP/NLU, and I will show the recent innovations on these different parts, why they work or not depending on their uses.

I will also talk about Machine Learning, where it works, where it doesn't, and why.

If you can come, do not hesitate to discuss with me.

Please check-out the [program](https://www.voicetechparis.com/2019/programme-mardi-26-novembre-2019/).
