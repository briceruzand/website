Hi all,

I just wanted to give you a small recap of my talk at Paris Voice Tech, last week.

As Noam Chomsky said, language is the mirror of the Mind Chomsky, and this is basically the idea I wanted to convey: we need to understand better the human mind if we want to better handle human languages. And the reverse could be true: if we handle better the human languages, we will be able to understand better the human mind.

<!--keep reading-->

Yes, machine learning has done great progress, and we now have decent speech to text and translation, but we still have a long way to go to handle human language.

I really hope that viky.ai will help pave the way to a better natural language understanding and thus a better understanding of the human mind.

Cheers!
