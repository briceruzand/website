Hello, dear community!

We also propose to share some relevant articles of watch and acculturation to textual analysis.
To start, let's see what NLP means...

<!--keep reading-->

NLP, NLU, TALN, Text-Mining, there are several ways to name semantic analysis on textual unstructured contents.

## Some basic definitions and concepts

Wikipedia is your friend if you start from scratch! The dedicated vocabulary is very well explained in the following articles:

* The main concept, [NLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing), its life, its work
* What is [text-mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_mining) ?

## Global articles

To synthesize these concepts, I encourage you to read these two very interesting articles that include all previously seen elements:

* [Introduction to NLP - Part I](https://www.ekino.com/articles/introduction-to-nlp-part-i)
* [Intelligence Artificielle : quelle diff√©rence entre NLP et NLU ?](https://www.lemagit.fr/conseil/Intelligence-Artificielle-quelle-difference-entre-NLP-et-NLU) (in French)

## What about the use cases?

Of course, it is mandatory to wonder how these technologies and solutions can bring you added-value. What are the use cases that can be exploited thanks to textual analysis?

* Forbes published [an article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2019/06/03/5-amazing-examples-of-natural-language-processing-nlp-in-practice/#1d361fa21b30) last June about potential applications
* Other articles present the overview of [possible applications](https://www.promptcloud.com/blog/9-best-examples-of-text-mining-analysis/)  (and there are many!)

So that's already enough to start your semantic culture :smile:
