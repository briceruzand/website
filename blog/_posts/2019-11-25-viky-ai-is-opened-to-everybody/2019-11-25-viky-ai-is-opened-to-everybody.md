Dear all,

Today is a great day, the viky.ai platform is now opened to everybody!

What does it mean?

Well, simply that prior to this day, you had to ask us for an invitation (which we  usually gladly provided), but after today you can register on your own and use the platform, anyway, anytime you want!

Isnt't that nice?

<!--keep reading-->

In any case, we provide you with a lot of documentation: philosophy, topics guide, how-to guide, reference guide, etc.

There are also a lot of public agents that you can use anyway you like.

Please browse through all of it, and use viky.ai the way you want!

Hope you will enjoy the platform as much as we did the last several months.
