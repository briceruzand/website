Dear all,

Today is a great day, the viky.ai platform is now opened to everybody!

This is important for us, because we have been working for more than two years on this new platform, and made all our efforts to create what we believe is a very easy to use <acronym title="Natural Language Processing">NLP</acronym> platform. We were lucky to have some [financing](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/212164/factsheet/fr) from the European Community, but this is just a start, the future is yours!

What does it mean?

Well, simply that prior to this day, you had to ask us for an invitation (which we  usually gladly provided), but after today you can register on your own and use the platform, anyway, anytime you want!

We have tested this platform with a lot of beta users, and we believe that it is now quite nice to use, so please [subscribe](/users/sign_in) (for free), and start using it, create your own agents and test them. The best way to start is [there](/doc/tutorials/getting-started-part-1/).

Isnt't that nice?

In any case, we provide you with a lot of documentations: starting guides, topics guides, how-to guides, reference guides, etc, all available [here](/doc/).

There are also a lot of public agents that you can use anyway you like. You need to [create an account](/users/sign_in) to look at them.

Please browse through all of it, and use viky.ai the way you want!

I hope you will enjoy the platform as much as we did the last several months.

You can create an account at [create account](/users/sign_in), this account is part of the [freemium plan](/pricing/).
