## Team

We are a team of enthousiastic AI and NLP lovers. Before viky.ai we have been working on semantic search engines for many years and this is still a very important activity for us.


## Project

The viky.ai project comes originally from our willingness to add some dialog into search engines. But we were a bit frustrated as this was only a specific application to the more general subject of NLP.

So we submitted our project to the Europeen Commission and got funded ! Please read the details here: https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/212164/factsheet/en
