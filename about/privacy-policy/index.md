# Privacy policy

<p class="legal-last-update">Last updated: November 14, 2019</p>


## Preamble

This Privacy Policy Statement informs you of the terms and procedures for the collection, processing and use of your personal data by the company Pertimm Developpement, registered with the Nanterre Area Companies and Commerce Register (RCS) under number 793 499 104, (hereinafter the "Company", "Pertimm" or "We"/"Us").

This statement also informs you of your data protection rights and obligations when using Pertimm websites (the "Websites"), published by the Company for computers or mobile devices and that provide a link to this Privacy Policy.


## Retention and Use of your personal data

The information collected on the forms for creating an account and managing your profile is recorded in a computer file by Pertimm to allow you to access the www.viky.ai platform.

When you use our Services, personal data may be requested.

The expression "personal data" denotes any and all information directly or indirectly identifying you, by reference to an identification number or to one or more elements specific to you.

We will not ask you for this information if you are only visiting our Websites, but you will not be able to access certain areas of those Websites (such as the forums) unless you register.

When personal data are collected, you will be informed whether the information We are asking you to disclose is required or optional, and the possible consequences of not providing the data.

When you create a Viky account ("Account"), We ask you to provide the following information: account name, password, and email address.

We use your data because they are necessary for the proper execution of a contract between you and Us. Thus, your data will be processed to:

* create, manage, and monitor Viky accounts;
* allow you to access and use the Services; and
* assist you in the event of technical issues using our Services.

This information is kept until the account is deleted and is only used to access the www.viky.ai platform.

This file is accessible only by the management and R&D engineers of the www.viky.ai platform.

In accordance with the [law "informatique et libertés"](https://www.cnil.fr/fr/la-loi-informatique-et-libertes), you can exercise your right of access to your personal data and have them corrected by contacting: Elisabeth Constant (administrative director) at 51 boulevard Voltaire, 92600 Asnières sur Seine and/or by email at hello@viky.ai.


## Consent and Processing of your personal data

Your personal data will never be communicated to third parties. You explicitly authorize the storage and processing of your data in order to make you aware of our services. You authorize a Pertimm consultant to potentially contact you for any business relationship or in order to improve the viky.ai platform.


## Withdrawal of Consent for your personal data

### Right of access to your personal data

You have the right to access, modify and/or delete your personal data at any time via the modification page of your account or by contacting our IT department:

* By post: 51 boulevard voltaire, 92600 Asnières sur Seine with a copy of an identity document. Ideally, by registered mail with acknowledgement of receipt.
* On site at our premises: with presentation of an identity document. The CNIL specifies: "It is possible to be accompanied by the person of your choice. The consultation should last long enough to take note conveniently and completely. It is possible to request a copy of the data."

The person in charge of the file has a maximum response time of 2 months from the date of the request, whether it was made by post or on site. The CNIL specifies: "If the request is incomplete (absence of the identity document for example), the person in charge of the file is entitled to request additional information: the deadline is then suspended and runs again once these elements have been provided".

The limits to the right of access are specified on the gdpr.eu website and [can be consulted](https://gdpr.eu/article-12-how-controllers-should-provide-personal-data-to-the-subject/).


## Security

The Company takes every appropriate technical and organizational measure, given the nature of the data and the risks inherent in data processing, to preserve a high level of data security, and in particular, to prevent it from becoming distorted or damaged, or from being accessed by unauthorized third parties.

Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology is therefore used to encrypt certain data; physical and logical backup procedures are implemented; and the HTTPS encryption protocol is used to secure access to data.

The Company reserves the right to initiate proceedings against any person who attempts to gain access to personal information not concerning him/her.
