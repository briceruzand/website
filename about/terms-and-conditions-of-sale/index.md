By placing an order for one or more items of Digital Content on the www.viky.ai website published by Pertimm linking to these TCS (hereinafter the "Website"), you undertake to comply with the TCS.

The present stipulations are without prejudice to any mandatory legal provisions on such matters and specifically, those provided for in the applicable laws of your country of habitual residence.

Unless proven otherwise, data recorded by Pertimm constitutes proof of all transactions between Pertimm and you. The history of transactions made on the Website between Pertimm and you may be consulted at any time on the "Profile" page accessible from the Website.

PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase Digital Content, you expressly agree that the Digital Content will be made available to you immediately, and you therefore expressly waive your right of withdrawal.


## <small>Article no. 2:</small> USER ACCOUNT

To purchase Digital Content, you must be the account holder of a Viky account (hereinafter the "Account").

For more information on Account creation rules, please refer to Pertimm's [Terms of Use](../terms-of-use/).


## <small>Article no. 3:</small> AVAILABILITY

Our offers of Digital Content are valid while visible on the Website. They may be withdrawn or modified at any time.


## <small>Article no. 4:</small> PRICE AND PAYMENT

__4.1__ You may purchase Digital Content using any of the payment methods offered by the Company. The available payment methods depend on the Digital Content you would like to purchase and your country of residence. Similarly, the price of an item of Digital Content may vary depending on the payment method selected and your country of residence. The Company shall not be held liable if one of the normally available payment methods for the Digital Content concerned is not available at the time of your order.

Some payment methods are managed by payment service providers for whom additional terms and costs may apply. Please review any such additional terms and costs before placing an order. You may also be required to create an account with such payment service providers (e.g. PayPal).

For orders via an Application, payments will be processed by the Application Platforms used.

__4.2__ Unless otherwise stated, prices are listed in the currency of your country of residence, and include taxes. They do not take into account any exchange rates or costs linked to specific payment methods. All costs arising from banking operations, especially international bank transfers, are your responsibility. If we do not receive the full payment for the Digital Content purchase, we will not be able to validate your order. In this case, we can give you the opportunity to either complete your payment or cancel your order. If you choose the latter, we will refund the payment(s) we had received from you for the order. The communication costs linked to purchasing and using Digital Content are the User's responsibility.

__4.3__ The Company may modify its rates at any time, without prior warning. However, in the event of payments using a non-instantaneous method (e.g. bank transfers), the applicable rate will be that in force on the day the order is placed.

__4.4__ You acknowledge that all payments you make on the Website, for yourself or any person you represent, are made with the authorization of the holder of the payment method used; failing this, the rules set forth by Article 4.5 shall apply. In any event, if you have not reached the age of majority in your country of habitual residence, you must obtain permission from your legal representative before making any payments on the Website, if applicable legislation, case law, or customs so require.

__4.5__ You acknowledge and accept that the Company is in no way liable for payments made fraudulently on its Website, irrespective of the payment method used. If it is transpires that you have made a fraudulent payment (i.e. without the free, informed consent of the holder of the payment method), Pertimm reserves the right to sanction you and bring appropriate legal proceedings against you. Please note that you will find more information about non-financial sanctions in the Terms of Use and that these sanctions may include your Account being banned definitively.

Also, if you have provided your login details to a third party who then makes a fraudulent payment, Pertimm may impose the same sanctions against you.
