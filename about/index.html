            We are a team of enthousiastic AI and NLP lovers. Before viky.ai we have been working on semantic search engines for many years and this is still a very important activity for us.

          <h2>Project</h2>
          <p>
            The viky.ai project comes originally from our willingness to add some dialog into search engines. But we were a bit frustrated as this was only a specific application to the more general subject of NLP.
          </p>
          <p>
            So we <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/212164/factsheet/en">submitted our project</a> to the Europeen Commission and got funded!
