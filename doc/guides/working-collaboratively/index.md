## Duplicate an agent

There are many public agents in viky.ai. These agents can be explored and tested by everyone in the platform. What if you find an agent that you would like to work with but you do not have the required access rights to it? Yes, you can create your own that has the same structure and behave the same. But it would be very tedious to do so for a complex agent.

Viky.ai allows you to duplicate any agent that is visible to you. When you view an agent, you can find a `Duplicate` button at the top of the `Overview` tab.

Click on the `Duplicate` button. Voila!, you have your very own agent that behaves exactly the same with just a click of a button. You can now edit and change the agent as per your requirements.
