## Introduction

### What is viky.ai?

viky.ai is an open source platform where you can __use, create and share bricks that help you analyse texts in any languages__. Text analysis can be quite difficult and it is our purpose to simplify that task as much as possible.

To do that, let's say that we want to build a house. For this, we want to use walls. And to build walls, we will need bricks.

  <h3>Why we have created viky.ai?</h3>
  <p>
    Many companies have needs for textual analysis, whether it is for concept extraction, structuring or cleaning data, tendencies analysis, categorization, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    We believe that creating modifiable, reusable bricks, walls and houses that can be shared collaboratively by the community, can help greatly simplify the hassle of handling textual analysis on problem that are indeed very similar: the bricks are always the same to build the house of your dreams.

### What is viky.ai for?

viky.ai can help you build houses (complex text analysis system), and it will help you do it by helping you create bricks and walls.

As of now, viky.ai provides bricks, maybe a few walls, but it is our goal that everybody will be able to build houses, or even streets, and ultimately get fully built house for their own use, and only redecorate it for your own need.

We named those houses, walls and bricks **agents**. Agents can be very simple (bricks), or very complex (houses).


## How the documentation is organized

Here is an overview of how the documentation is organized to help you navigate through it:

* __Tutorials__ take you by the hand through a series of steps to create a first agent. Start here if you're new to viky.ai.
* __Topic guides__ discuss key topics and concepts at a fairly high level and provide useful background information and explanation.
* __How-to guides__ are recipes. They guide you through the steps involved in addressing key problems and use-cases. They are more advanced than tutorials and assume some knowledge of how viky.ai works.
* __Reference guides__ contain technical reference for APIs. They describe how it works and how to use it but assume that you have a basic understanding of key concepts.
