## Our pricing philosophy

First of all, it is important to say that all functionalities of viky.ai are available to all users, whether they have a freemium account or not.

Here are some of the functionalities available to everybody without limitation:

* create agents,
* create interpretations,
* create entities,
* import and export entities,
* use the agent's tests suite,
* use the playground for agents,
* use the console to test your agent
* etc.

However, in order to equitably share the use of the platform, we have introduced two main limitations :

* One is based upon the volume of the agents you can create : it is possible to create as many agents as you want up to the point where the total number of entities and formulations of those agents reaches a certain level.
* one is based upon the number of API requests used on your agents.

Beyond those limitations, you can contact us for more information about pricing at  hello@viky.ai.


## Freemium users limitations for the platform


Freemium users have three defined limitations:

* Total number of entities and formulations included in all of the user's owned agents: 3000
* Total number of API requests per day: 400 requests
* Total number of API requests per second: 3 requests
